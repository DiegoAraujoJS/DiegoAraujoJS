### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer passionate about creating solutions with an open number of means, tools, and paradigms. 

I am currently working every single day in building apps for my portfolio to show the world my development capabilities.

My complete tech stack is Python | JavaScript | TypeScript | React JS | Redux | Node JS | Express | PostgreSQL | MySQL | Sequelize | HTML | CSS3

During the last month of July, I have been working on a groupal project where we created an application that manages your online courses. There, you can take as well as give an online course and synchronize the date of your course with your Google Calendar, and chat with the professor that will give you the course.
