### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer passionate about creating solutions with an open number of means, tools, and paradigms. 

I am currently working every single day in building apps for my portfolio to show the world my development capabilities.

My complete tech stack is Python | JavaScript | TypeScript | React JS | Redux | Node JS | Express | PostgreSQL | MySQL | Sequelize | HTML | CSS3

I want to be part of a company that gives me space for developing my primary capabilities and where I can find space for creative and out-of-the-box developing of the application infrastructure.

If you want to contact me you send me a message through Linkedin or an email to diegolaraujo96@gmail.com
